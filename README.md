# Human-Habits-Statistics-Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the variability and consistency of human daily habits using statistics and probability concepts.

Instead of using machine learning or prediction models, this project emphasizes understanding behavior patterns through statistical reasoning.

## Problem Statement
To analyze daily human habits and identify which habits are consistent and which are unpredictable using statistical techniques.

## Dataset Description
- Type: Simulated behavioral dataset
- Number of records: 90
- Features:
  - Day_Type (Weekday / Weekend)
  - Sleep_Hours
  - Screen_Time
  - Study_Hours
  - Physical_Activity

## Statistical Techniques Used
- Mean and Standard Deviation
- Variability Analysis
- Probability Calculation
- Hypothesis Testing (t-test)
- Data Visualization using Bar Charts

## Key Insights
- Screen time shows the highest variability and is the most unpredictable habit.
- Physical activity is the most consistent habit.
- Around 48% of individuals achieve healthy sleep duration (>7 hours).
- Sleep patterns differ between weekdays and weekends.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how statistics and probability concepts can be applied to real-world behavioral data to derive meaningful insights and support data-driven decision-making.
